# Gravity — Turn-Based Multiplayer Board Game

## One-liner
Gravity is a deep, tactical, turn-based sci‑fi board game you can play asynchronously with friends—no scheduling, no live sessions, just smart decisions and satisfying consequences.

## Elevator pitch (30 seconds)
Gravity is built for players who love crunchy strategy but hate coordinating calendars. Take your turn when you have time, coordinate with your crew, manage ship systems, and outplay opponents in a tense, high-stakes space survival race. Every decision matters—positioning, power routing, repairs, scanning, acquiring resources, and combat—without needing everyone online at once.

## The problem (pain points you’re solving)
- **Scheduling is the final boss**: Your group wants deep games, but real-time sessions fall apart.
- **“Async” games often feel shallow**: Many asynchronous games remove the tension, tactics, or meaningful interaction.
- **Strategy games can be opaque**: Players want clear feedback and consistent rules, not chaotic outcomes.
- **Multiplayer friction kills momentum**: Waiting on players, unclear state, and confusing turns make people quit.

## The solution (your promise)
Gravity delivers a *serious* tactical board game experience designed from the ground up for asynchronous multiplayer:
- Make one great decision at a time.
- See the board clearly.
- Trust the rules.
- Keep the game moving.

## Core value proposition
- **Deep tactical gameplay** with ship systems, crew roles, and high-impact actions.
- **Asynchronous multiplayer** so players can take turns on their own schedule.
- **Cross-platform architecture** (shared engine + server + web client) for portability and consistency.
- **Deterministic, rules-driven game logic** that keeps outcomes understandable and fair.

## Who it’s for
- **Busy adults** who love strategy games but can’t guarantee a 2–4 hour session.
- **Tabletop groups** that want ongoing games across time zones.
- **Strategy gamers** who want meaningful choices, not clicker progression.
- **Competitive friends** who want a game they can argue about *because* the rules are clear.

## What makes Gravity compelling
### High-stakes decision loops
Every turn asks a hard question:
- Do you **repair** now or gamble for resources?
- Do you **maneuver** for position or **power** systems for defense?
- Do you **scan/acquire** to get ahead or **attack** to keep others from stabilizing?

### Tactical ship management (not just “move and shoot”)
Your ship is a living system. Power, damage, and repairs create real tradeoffs that evolve across turns.

### Asynchronous that still feels interactive
You’re not playing alone “near other people.” Opponents’ choices shape the board, the pressure, and the timing of your risk.
